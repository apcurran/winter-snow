# Winter Snowfall

## Three data layout designs for the same project:
[Array of structures (AoS)](https://apcurran.github.io/winter-snow/data-array-of-structures-example)

[Structure of arrays (SoA)](https://apcurran.github.io/winter-snow/data-structure-of-arrays-example)

[Structure of arrays (SoA) with a single interleaved array](https://apcurran.github.io/winter-snow/data-interleaved-array-example)
    - This one-dimensional array data design has optimal cache-friendlieness for the CPU and memory

### Features:
- Vanilla JS with Canvas API

- ES6 Class syntax for snowflake objects

- Dynamic snowflakes generated based upon window width

- Randomized snowflakes with unique values
